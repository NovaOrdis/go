* Mention the build wrappers on NOKB under "Projects" somewhere, similarily to https://kb.novaordis.com/index.php/Novaordis-release-tools
* Make the "keep" count configurable
* Provide for in-line help so I can use it in production
* Document the build and new release process
* Install it on rackstation and start production
